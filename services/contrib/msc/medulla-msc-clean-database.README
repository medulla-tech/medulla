Pulse 2 MSC Database Cleanup Script

This script will purge all terminated commands where the creation date is
older than x days. A terminated command is on the "done" or on the "failed"
state.

Example:
% python clean-msc.py <mysql_uri> <days>

With [mysql_uri]:
mysql://<user>:<password>@127.0.0.1/<inventory_database>

Post-cleanup, you may want to optimize your database using optim.sql.
