# A simple setup script for creating a Windows service. See the comments in the
# Config.py and ServiceHandler.py files for more information on how to set this
# up.
#
# Installing the service is done with the option --install <Name> and
# uninstalling the service is done with the option --uninstall <Name>. The
# value for <Name> is intended to differentiate between different invocations
# of the same service code -- for example for accessing different databases or
# using different configuration files.
