Mandriva Management Console
---------------------------

The MMC (Mandriva Management Console) is made of two parts:

* An agent running on the machine to manage. We call it « MMC agent ». 
  The agent exports to the network several plugins that allow to manage 
  the machine. Of course, there can be multiple agents running on the 
  network. The agent and its plugins are written in Python.

* A web interface, that talks to the agent(s) using XML-RPC. The interface 
  is written in PHP, and use the scriptaculous framework to feature an
  AJAX experience.
